## Business Contxt
Aurora Retail Co. is a mid-sized retail business operating across multiple product categories. While Aurora consistently caputred transaction-level data, leadership lacked clarity on:
- Which categories and customers were driving revenue
- How sales performance evolved over time
- When operational demand was highest

Decisions related to inventory, promotions, and staffing were being made without a consolidated analytical view.

This analysis was commissioned to convert raw transactional data into decision-ready insights using SQL.
